  <description>===Enable this ONLY if you are playing the game with Japanese voices!===

This patch for Custom Sub Menu prevents the Japanese dialogue from being muted when opening doors in dungeons.

These voice lines were never recorded in English, so this package should only be enabled if you are playing with Japanese voices.</description>
